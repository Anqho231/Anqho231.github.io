<p>For my meme mashup, I decided to come up with a comical meme about common animation errors or flaws in popular anime series and how it affects the animation industry or studios in Japan. For my main background, I am using a scene from the anime Shirobako, which light-heartedly and heavily portrays how Japanese animators work. This scene introduces Seiichi Kinoshita, the director of Musashino Animation, and his team targeting against a "bad" or "lousy" new animator for not doing his job right. Then I took out different flawed anime characters and Usagi's hand from Sailor Moon off from their original images by using the object selection tool on Photoshop, changed their sizes, and manipulated them around as if they are all in the same scene trying to haunt down the "bad" animator. However, I decided to create a twist by adding thought bubbles with disproportionately drawn characters from Naruto and the cats from the Cats Zoning Out meme because I want to indicate that animators, who worked on popular anime series, also make mistakes and regret, which causes them to personally attack or pretend to sympathize new animators because of their insecurities. Although animators tend to make animation flaws on accident that end up being on screen, as a result, most of their works become successful anyways. Overall, the message of this meme is to deglamorize the lifestyle of working at an anime studio, and to convey that not all animation or animators are perfect.
